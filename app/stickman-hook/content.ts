        "title": "The Definition of 'Perfect Timing' for Optimal Swings",
        "description": "Perfect timing is achieved by releasing the hook precisely at the **bottom of the swing arc**. Releasing at this lowest point converts potential energy into maximum kinetic energy, achieving the **greatest horizontal distance and highest speed** for the subsequent jump."
      },
      {
        "title": "Progressive Difficulty Through Dynamic Obstacles",
        "description": "Increasing difficulty is achieved primarily through three factors: **1) Widening distances between hook points**; **2) Introducing moving and rotating obstacles** that must be dodged mid-swing; and **3) Altering environmental physics** (e.g., platforms with less grip or lower air friction) that require faster reaction times."
      },
      {
        "title": "Fluid Physics and Animation Feedback",
        "description": "The **smooth animation and accurate physical movements** are crucial for player success. The realistic animation of the Stickman's body position and the visible tension of the rope help players **instantly predict the momentum and trajectory** of the current swing, allowing for precise adjustment of the next crucial hook."

      "items": [
        {
          "value": "long-term-strategy-speed-precision",
          "question": "[Long-Term Strategy] What is the best long-term strategy to maximize 'Clear Speed' and 'Operational Precision'?",
          "answer": "**Expert Strategy**: The best long-term strategy is to **establish stable swinging techniques** first as a baseline for precision. Once stability is mastered, immediately pivot to pursuing the **shortest path**. The shortest path requires perfect release timing on top of perfect swings, representing the ultimate fusion of speed and precision."
        },
        {
          "value": "high-vs-low-swing",
          "question": "[Swinging Strategy] How to determine which obstacles should be navigated with a low-altitude, high-speed swing versus a high-parabolic swing?",
          "answer": "**Momentum Judgment**: **Low-altitude, high-speed swings** are used to **maintain horizontal momentum**, pass through narrow gaps, or slide across platforms. **High-parabolic swings** are used to clear **tall obstacles**, **reset momentum**, or buy **more observation time** when the next hook point is uncertain."
        },
        {
          "value": "skins-impact",
          "question": "[Resource Allocation] Is there a system for unlocking skins/aesthetics in the game? If so, do these skins subtly affect operational feel (e.g., visually or collision size)?",
          "answer": "**Official Answer**: All skins/aesthetics in Stickman Hook are **purely visual**. They **do not affect** the character's physical collision size, momentum transfer, or hook hitbox. Feel free to choose your preferred style."
        },
        {
          "value": "long-vs-short-amplitude",
          "question": "[Strategic Trade-off] In difficult levels, how do you decide the trade-off between using a 'long swing amplitude' and a 'short swing amplitude'?",
          "answer": "**Amplitude Strategy**: A **long swing amplitude** is used when you need to **maximize speed and distance** (e.g., crossing a super-wide gap) for high momentum transfer. A **short swing amplitude** is used for **precise direction adjustment**, **maintaining current height**, or for quick micro-adjustments in **cramped spaces** to prevent an over-swing that leads to a loss of control."
        },
        {
          "value": "hidden-momentum-trick",
          "question": "[Advanced Technique] Is there a hidden momentum trick only known by top players to maintain horizontal velocity without hooking onto anything?",
          "answer": "**Elite Technique**: Yes, it's called **'Inertia Toss' or 'Momentum Preservation.'** The trick is to release the hook precisely **just past the lowest point of the swing arc**. This converts momentum into a flatter, more horizontal parabola, minimizing vertical drop and maintaining maximum horizontal speed in the air for longer."
        },
        {
          "value": "limit-release-point",
          "question": "[Limit Timing] Regarding hook release timing, is there a 'limit release point' that instantly converts vertical velocity into horizontal velocity?",
          "answer": "**Limit Release Point**: This point is exactly at the **'lowest point' of the swing arc**. Physically, this is the instant potential energy is fully converted to kinetic energy, vertical velocity is zero, and horizontal velocity is at its peak. Releasing here provides the **maximum horizontal initial velocity** and the longest flight distance."
        },
        {
          "value": "collision-manipulation",
          "question": "[Collision Utilization] How can players utilize collisions with obstacles (if allowed) to forcibly change the swing direction or gain a slight extra push?",
          "answer": "**Edge Graze**: Top players utilize the **'Edge Graze'** technique. By making a **very slight, calculated contact with the sharp corner** of a static obstacle, you can achieve a controlled **'Ricochet' effect** used to correct a failing trajectory or, in specific situations, gain a tiny extra horizontal boost."
        },
        {
          "value": "newbie-common-errors",
          "question": "[Newbie Pain Points] What are the three most common errors that cause new players to lose momentum or fail to reach the finish line?",
          "answer": "The three major errors are: 1) **Releasing the hook too early** (releasing during the upward phase of the swing, directing momentum vertically instead of horizontally). 2) **Over-relying on vertical jumping** (instead of the horizontal speed generated by swinging). 3) **Poor hook point selection** (choosing a point that creates a backward pull)."
        },
        {
          "value": "hook-point-searching-training",
          "question": "[Visual Training] How can new players effectively train themselves to quickly locate the next hook point on the screen?",
          "answer": "**Training Method**: Implement **'Visual Pre-Aiming.'** The moment you hook onto the current point, your eyes must **immediately shift and lock onto** the next (or next two) potential hook points. Shifting attention from the current action to the future decision point is key to increasing speed."
        },
        {
          "value": "precision-vs-speed-balance",
          "question": "[Efficiency Balance] How to effectively balance the need for precision in complex obstacles with the efficiency of fast level traversal?",
          "answer": "**Balance Principle**: Adhere to the principle that **'Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.'** In complex obstacle areas, prioritize **smoothness and precision** of the operation. Slightly slowing down for a clean, high-momentum swing is far more efficient than attempting reckless speed and failing/restarting."
        },
        {
          "value": "technical-lag-solution",
          "question": "[Technical Troubleshooting] What are the most common lag or physics delay issues? What is the one-click solution for fast-paced operational games?",
          "answer": "**Troubleshooting**: Common lag stems from **high-density physics calculation**. The one-click solution is to **disable special effects (lower graphics quality)** and **close all unnecessary background applications** to dedicate maximum system resources to the game's physics engine."
        },
        {
          "value": "progress-sync-issue",
          "question": "[Progress Synchronization] What is the primary issue encountered when unlocking new levels or when progress is not synchronized? How to clearly guide players to check/refresh the game state?",
          "answer": "**Guidance Steps**: The primary issue is often **unstable network connection or stale browser cache**. First, check the network status, then **refresh the game page**. If the issue persists, **clear the browser cache** to force a fresh synchronization of the latest game progress."
        },
        {
          "value": "platform-control-difference",
          "question": "[Platform Difference] What is the precision difference in hook release between mobile touch and PC click controls? How to offer control optimization advice for different platforms?",
          "answer": "**Control Optimization**: **PC (Mouse Click)** offers higher precision; adjust **mouse sensitivity to medium-low** for finer release control. **Mobile (Touch)** offers faster response but slightly less precision; advise a light, **'tap-and-release'** operation style to avoid holding the touch down too long, which can mess up the release timing."
