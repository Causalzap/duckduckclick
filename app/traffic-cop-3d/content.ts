      {
        "value": "long-term-upgrade-path",
        "question": "[Long-Term Strategy] How to Maximize Enforcement Efficiency and Police Rank Upgrades?",
        "answer": "**Official Strategy**: To maximize efficiency, prioritize completing **Main Story Missions** first to unlock critical enforcement permissions and areas. Supplement this by engaging in **Side Missions** to steadily accumulate necessary experience and resources."
      },
      {
        "value": "moral-choice-impact",
        "question": "[Moral Choices] What specific content is permanently affected by the moral choices you make?",
        "answer": "**Deep Player Insight**: Moral choices permanently shape your career path. For example, choosing the **'Bad Cop'** route unlocks unique skill trees and restricted zones, but significantly increases the risk of negative in-game events and internal affairs investigations."
      },
      {
        "value": "mid-game-resource-split",
        "question": "[Resource Allocation] How should resources be allocated during the mid-game phase?",
        "answer": "**Official Tip**: We recommend a **60/40 investment split**. Allocate $\\mathbf{60\\%}$ to **Police Equipment** (upgrading vehicle performance for pursuits) and $\\mathbf{40\\%}$ to **Intelligence Tools** (enhancing scanner accuracy and clue detection) to maintain a balance between action and analysis."
      },
      {
        "value": "interception-priority",
        "question": "[Interception Priority] How should players prioritize which violations to intercept?",
        "answer": "**Expert Standard**: Always prioritize interception for **Serious Violations** (Drunk Driving, Felony Evasion) that directly impact public safety. Minor, non-safety violations can be bypassed or recorded for later processing to conserve time and focus enforcement resources efficiently."
      },
      {
        "value": "advanced-intel-tricks",
        "question": "[Advanced Intelligence] Are there any advanced intelligence correlation tricks used by top players?",
        "answer": "**Elite Secret**: Top players utilize **'Detail Cross-Reference.'** This involves swiftly comparing subtle cues, like the driver's vehicle registration date, emotional state, and observed vehicle wear, to quickly establish their identity and accurately assess the probability of a higher-risk violation."
      },
      {
        "value": "pursuit-tactics",
        "question": "[Pursuit Tactics] Are there tactical interception tricks during a chase?",
        "answer": "**Official Guide**: Yes, employ **'Terrain Funneling.'** Utilize local geography, traffic density, and road structures to limit the suspect's escape routes, thereby maximizing the chance of a successful physical interception (Ram) while minimizing collateral damage."
      },
      {
        "value": "pa-speaker-impact",
        "question": "[PA Speaker Effect] How does the content of PA announcements influence a suspect's behavior?",
        "answer": "**Deep Player Insight**: The tone and content of PA warnings are critical. **Calm, authoritative tones** are more likely to encourage the suspect to pull over safely. **Aggressive, warning-heavy tones** can, paradoxically, increase the likelihood of the suspect accelerating and attempting a more desperate evasion."
      },
      {
        "value": "beginner-common-mistakes",
        "question": "[Beginner Mistakes] What are the Top 3 common mistakes made by new traffic cops?",
        "answer": "1. **Over-Interpreting Intelligence**: Jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence. 2. **Failure to Verify ID**: Not prioritizing the check of identity documents immediately. 3. **Underestimating Risk Vehicles**: Treating heavily modified or damaged vehicles the same as standard traffic."
      },
      {
        "value": "minor-violation-release",
        "question": "[Time Management] When is it acceptable to let a minor violation go?",
        "answer": "**Official Strategy**: It is acceptable and recommended to immediately let a minor violation go (e.g., faulty turn signal) when it **poses no immediate safety threat** and you need to preserve time or resources for a more critical public safety incident (e.g., a high-speed chase unfolding nearby)."
      },
      {
        "value": "attention-switching-training",
        "question": "[Training Method] How to rapidly switch focus between multi-task observation and operation?",
        "answer": "**Expert Practice**: Train your **'Multi-Task Gaze.'** Practice simultaneously observing the vehicle's interior (for contraband/clues) and monitoring the external traffic flow/minimap. This builds the necessary muscle memory for complex, multi-variable street management."
      },
      {
        "value": "technical-lag-solutions",
        "question": "[Troubleshooting] How to resolve lag and loading issues efficiently?",
        "answer": "**Official Solution**: Immediately **Enable 'Low Graphics Mode'** in the settings. Ensure you close all background applications and maintain a **stable, high-speed internet connection** to minimize loading times and in-game stuttering."
      },
      {
        "value": "progress-sync-issues",
        "question": "[Technical Fix] What causes task progress or unlock abnormalities, and how to resolve them?",
        "answer": "**Official Tip**: Abnormalities are usually caused by a failure to save the mission state. Always **check your in-game Mission Log** to confirm all completion criteria have been met. If the issue persists, try **restarting the game** to force a server synchronization."
      },
      {
        "value": "lights-siren-skill",
        "question": "[Operation Skill] What is the skill behind using lights and sirens effectively?",
        "answer": "**Expert Insight**: Lights and sirens should be used with **'Precision Intimidation.'** Activating them at the precise moment you pull behind the violator increases the psychological impact, which can dramatically raise the success rate of a smooth, immediate stop and increase overall mission efficiency."
