      {
        "value": "long-term-vehicle-path",
        "question": "[Long-Term Strategy] What is the Best Vehicle Path to Maximize Score and Leaderboard Rank?",
        "answer": "**Official Strategy**: The optimal path is to unlock the **first 5 Surfboards** for mastery of Air Control, then immediately pivot to acquiring the **Tier-1 Jet-Ski**. The Jet-Ski's base speed and collision buffer are essential for the high-score ranges (3000+ meters), where raw speed and survivability outweigh complex trick mechanics. **Jet-Skis are the ultimate key to top rankings.**"
      },
      {
        "value": "speed-curve-practice-segment",
        "question": "[Time Optimization] At what distance does the game's speed curve exhibit a significant exponential jump, and which segment requires focused practice?",
        "answer": "**Deep Player Insight**: The speed curve becomes **exponentially aggressive between the 1500-meter and 2500-meter segments**. Players must dedicate practice to this range, as marginal errors become catastrophic. This is where **Momentum Chain maintenance** is the only way to survive and thrive."
      },
      {
        "value": "mid-game-resource-allocation",
        "question":"[Resource Allocation] Should I prioritize diverse Surfboard variety or the fastest Jet-Ski in the mid-game? Which is more competitive?",
        "answer": "**Official Tip**: Prioritize **acquiring the fastest available Jet-Ski** (Tier-1). While diverse Surfboards offer fun, the Jet-Ski‚Äôs superior **Top Speed** and **Collision Absorption** provide a distinct competitive advantage for achieving new personal bests and climbing the leaderboard swiftly in the high-speed mid-game."
      },
      {
        "value": "risk-reward-jump-standard",
        "question":"[Risk Management] How to judge if a Risk Rock Jump is worth attempting for the 5-Star reward versus safely navigating around it? (Provide a speed/distance standard)",
        "answer": "**Expert Standard**: **Attempt the 5-Star Jump only if your current speed is above 90% of your maximum potential speed (Jet-Ski recommended).** If your speed is below 80%, the necessary distance and air time for a perfect landing are unachievable, making safe navigation the only viable option. Always prioritize speed chain over risk."
      },
      {
        "value": "advanced-water-tricks",
        "question": "[Advanced Tricks] Are there hidden water surface operations, like 'Perfect Landing' or 'Side Clipping,' that significantly boost speed or score Buffs?",
        "answer": "**Elite Secret**: Yes, the **'Perfect Water Entry'** technique. After a jump, ensure your vehicle touches the water at a **flat 0-degree angle** to trigger a **Micro-Acceleration Burst** (a brief speed buff). Additionally, **'Side-Clipping'** a non-lethal buoy just before a jump can reset momentum decay, granting slightly longer jump distance."
      },
      {
        "value": "delayed-jump-timing",
        "question": "[Jump Mechanics] Is there a 'delayed jump timing' technique to improve jump accuracy during high-speed maneuvering?",
        "answer": "**Deep Player Insight**: Focus on **'Pre-emptive Input.'** During high speed, the actual moment you see the obstacle is often too late. Instead, calculate the jump based on the **distance of the rock/ramp** when it is **1.5 vehicle lengths away**, inputting the jump slightly *before* your eyes register the need. This compensates for input lag and speed."
      },
      {
        "value": "minimal-movement-dodging",
        "question": "[High-Speed Control] How to utilize minimal left/right micro-movements to dodge obstacles while maximizing speed retention?",
        "answer": "**Official Guide**: Only use the **slightest steering taps** to dodge the center mass of an obstacle. **Avoid holding the steering button.** Holding the button causes the vehicle to enter a high-friction turn, bleeding speed. Micro-taps allow you to stay in the **high-speed straight-line momentum state** while narrowly avoiding collision."
      },
      {
        "value": "beginner-speed-loss-errors",
        "question": "[Beginner Mistakes] What are the Top 3 common mistakes that lead to speed loss or game failure for new players?",
        "answer": "1. **Over-Steering**: Holding the left/right steer too long, which drastically reduces momentum. 2. **Mistimed Jumps**: Jumping too early (missing the ramp's apex) or too late (hitting the rock). 3. **Ignoring the Momentum Chain**: Failing to maintain speed through turns, thus missing the opportunity to use speed-gained Buffs."
      },
      {
        "value": "beginner-risk-timing",
        "question": "[New Player Progression] How should new players determine when to stop safe coasting and begin actively attempting high-risk 5-Star Jumps?",
        "answer": "**Recommended Threshold**: New players should only begin practicing 5-Star Jumps **after consistently reaching the 1000-meter mark** with a stable speed. This ensures they have sufficient experience with the base physics before introducing the high-risk, high-reward mechanics."
      },
      {
        "value": "jet-ski-stability-training",
        "question": "[Training Method] What are effective training methods to help beginners maintain stable control while driving the faster Jet-Ski?",
        "answer": "**Expert Practice**: Practice the **'Vision Lead'** technique: **Focus your eyes on the platform 3 seconds ahead of your vehicle.** This forces your hands to react to *future* obstacles, not *current* obstacles, significantly improving stability and control during high-speed Jet-Ski runs."
      },
      {
        "value": "technical-lag-solutions",
        "question": "[Troubleshooting] What are the most common lag/delay issues, and the one-click solution for fast-paced controls?",
        "answer": "**Official Solution**: The most common issue is **Input Throttling** due to high-fidelity water effects. The one-click fix is to **Enable 'Low Graphics Mode'** (or disable 'Motion Blur') in the settings. This forces higher FPS, which directly translates to reduced input delay and more responsive controls."
      },
      {
        "value": "leaderboard-sync-issues",
        "question": "[Technical Fix] What are the common leaderboard score upload issues? How should players check their network status and synchronization process?",
        "answer": "**Official Guide**: Common issues stem from sudden network drops. Always **refresh the game page** after a failed upload attempt. To check the status: verify your internet speed is **above 5Mbps**, and ensure the in-game 'Sync Icon' appears green before closing the browser."
      },
      {
        "value": "input-sensitivity-fix",
        "question": "[Control Fix] What are the common issues with unresponsive jump operations on mobile and PC? What are the suggested optimization settings?",
        "answer": "**Optimization Tip**: On PC, check your **Key Mapping Delay** settings to ensure your jump key triggers instantly. On Mobile, ensure your **Finger Tracking Sensitivity** is set to **'High'** to prevent micro-delays in touch input. In both cases, ensure your input device is fully charged (or wired) for best responsiveness."
