      "items": [
        {
          "value": "long-term-strategy-efficiency",
          "question": "[Long-Term Strategy] To maximize mission completion rate and unlock top-tier cars, what should be the focus of upgrades?",
          "answer": "**Expert Strategy**: Focus investment equally on both **Engine Acceleration** and **Brake Handling** upgrades. Acceleration is key for reaching targets quickly, while precise braking is non-negotiable for zero-tolerance collision avoidance at high speeds."
        },
        {
          "value": "new-car-investment",
          "question": "[Investment Threshold] Once currency accumulates past a certain threshold, should I continue upgrading the old car or purchase the next-tier top vehicle?",
          "answer": "**Investment Rule**: Once coin accumulation reaches the threshold to purchase the **next-tier top vehicle**, immediately stop upgrading the old car and invest in the new vehicle. Top-tier cars offer inherently superior handling and collision physics, which is more beneficial than marginal upgrades to an older model."
        },
        {
          "value": "checkpoint-mode-pacing",
          "question": "[Mode Strategy] How to balance speed and safety in 'Checkpoint' mode?",
          "answer": "**Pacing Guide**: In 'Checkpoint' mode, the goal is to **maintain a steady, reasonable average speed**. Avoid unnecessary full-speed bursts and focus on smooth, safe maneuvering to ensure you consistently meet the time limit without risking a costly, time-consuming crash."
        },
        {
          "value": "score-mode-multiplier",
          "question": "[Mode Strategy] How to utilize the 'Score' mode to maximize the score multiplier?",
          "answer": "**Multiplier Technique**: In 'Score' mode, maximize the multiplier by executing **continuous, extreme 'near-misses' (or 'grazes')**. The effectiveness of the score multiplier increases significantly with each consecutive close call, rewarding high-risk, precise driving."
        },
        {
          "value": "advanced-weaving-technique",
          "question": "[Advanced Technique] What advanced weaving techniques do top players master to navigate traffic?",
          "answer": "**Elite Skill**: Top players utilize **AI vehicle anticipation**. They study the traffic's predictable movement patterns to identify and preemptively target the gaps that are about to open, effectively creating their own safe path through the dense flow."
        },
        {
          "value": "micro-correction-skill",
          "question": "[Handling Skill] How to proficiently use micro-corrections to correct high-speed skids and preserve momentum?",
          "answer": "**Micro-Correction**: Skids are inevitable at high speed. Use **quick, minimal counter-steering taps** (micro-corrections) combined with **slight throttle modulation** to regain control without losing significant speed or direction. Over-correcting is the primary cause of momentum loss."
        },
        {
          "value": "top-car-performance",
          "question": "[Vehicle Performance] How do top-tier vehicles' performance and handling compare to initial vehicles?",
          "answer": "**Performance Gap**: Top-tier vehicles feature significantly **superior handling stability, acceleration, and braking**, but they also have **better collision physics**. They are much more forgiving, making controlled near-misses easier and safer than with starter cars."

        {
          "value": "newbie-common-errors",
          "question": "[Newbie Pain Points] What are the common beginner errors that cause frequent crashes?",
          "answer": "Common errors include **driving too close to the edge/barriers**, **frequent, abrupt lane changes** (which limit reaction time), and **insufficient anticipation** of multi-lane traffic flow."
        },
        {
          "value": "traffic-flow-training",
          "question": "[Training Method] How should new players practice predicting the movement of traffic flow?",
          "answer": "**Training Tip**: Focus your attention on **multi-lane traffic patterns** (3-4 cars ahead). Practice anticipating their line of motion and potential lane changes. This trains your brain to process the dynamic environment faster than your hands react."
        },
        {
          "value": "speed-safety-training",
          "question": "[Training Method] How to combine time pressure control with quick reaction training?",
          "answer": "**Combined Training**: Use **Time Pressure Missions** (like Checkpoint) to force rapid decision-making. Simultaneously focus on **line memory and quick reaction training**—practice driving the same challenging section repeatedly to build muscle memory for optimal, safe lines."
        },
        {
          "value": "technical-lag-solutions",
          "question": "[Technical Troubleshooting] What are the common solutions for lag and input delay?",
          "answer": "**Quick Fix**: **Close all unnecessary background programs**, **reduce the graphics quality settings** (especially resolution and shadows), and ensure your device's operating system is up-to-date to maintain performance for fast-paced action."
        },
        {
          "value": "progress-sync-issue",
          "question": "[Data Integrity] How to handle unlock or progress synchronization issues?",
          "answer": "**Sync Check**: Always ensure you have a **stable network connection**. If a synchronization issue occurs, try **refreshing the game** or clearing your browser's cache to force a new sync with the server."
