Unique Nested Obstacle Design**\n\nObstacles designed as **'balloons trapped within other balloons'** compel players to re-evaluate elimination priorities. This prevents the mechanical gameplay caused by simple stacking and guides players toward more **forward-thinking strategic decisions**.",

    "items": [
      {
        "value": "long-term-strategy-efficiency",
        "question": "[Long-Term Strategy] What is the best strategy to maximize star ratings and efficiency?",
        "answer": "**Expert Strategy**: Prioritize **rapid top-layer clearance** while maintaining constant vigilance over the **7-slot bottom bar**. The key is balancing speed with efficient space management, ensuring the bottom bar never becomes a bottleneck."
      },
      {
        "value": "difficulty-assessment",
        "question": "[Difficulty Assessment] How should players assess level difficulty and allocate Power-ups?",
        "answer": "**Official Tip**: On **difficult, complex levels**, strategically combine multiple Power-ups to guarantee a 3-star rating. On **easier, straightforward levels**, conserve Power-ups and focus purely on matching to maximize resource savings for later challenges."
      },
      {
        "value": "resource-allocation-midgame",
        "question": "[Resource Allocation] Should I prioritize powerful Power-ups or new balloons in the mid-game?",
        "answer": "**Official Tip**: Mid-game investment should lean towards **strong Power-ups** to significantly boost puzzle-solving capability on harder levels. Complement this by gradually unlocking **new balloon sets** for visual variety and slight strategic differentiation."
      },
      {
        "value": "priority-management",
        "question": "[Priority Management] How to judge which balloon to release to avoid cluttering the bar with unmatched colors?",
        "answer": "**Advanced Strategy**: Prioritize releasing balloons that **immediately complete a match** or those that **reveal a critical underlying balloon**. Avoid releasing unmatched colors that will fill a slot unless that move is absolutely necessary to prevent a deadlock, as the space pressure is not worth the risk."
      },
      {
        "value": "advanced-color-management",
        "question": "[Advanced Technique] How do top players utilize color management to avoid complex deadlocks?",
        "answer": "**Elite Secret**: Top players employ **'Color Reservation'**. They actively choose to leave one or two slots open for specific **key colors** that they predict will be needed to unlock future clusters. This prevents complex deadlocks by ensuring the right key is always available."
      },
      {
        "value": "consecutive-match-bonus",
        "question": "[Timer Control] Can consecutive, fast eliminations activate a time freeze or bonus?",
        "answer": "**Game Mechanics**: Yes, **Consecutive Quick Matches** activate a **brief 'Time Freeze' window** (bonus time). Mastering the speed and sequence of matches is vital for extending the solving time and achieving high scores under pressure."
      },
      {
        "value": "3d-view-trick",
        "question": "[3D View Trick] How to use the 3D perspective to quickly locate hidden critical balloons?",
        "answer": "**Visual Trick**: Use **'Micro-Angle Shift'**. Instead of wide rotations, use small, fast angle adjustments (less than 10 degrees) to exploit the way the shadows and overlaps shift. This technique helps quickly reveal the color and position of crucial balloons hidden deep within the stack."
      },
      {
        "value": "beginner-common-mistakes",
        "question": "[Beginner Mistakes] What are the common errors that lead to frustration for new players?",
        "answer": "Common errors include: **Randomly picking visible balloons**, **failing to constantly monitor the bottom bar space**, and **neglecting to predict the next 3 moves** (lack of forward planning)."
      },
      {
        "value": "prediction-training",
        "question": "[Cognitive Training] How to train multi-step color prediction effectively?",
        "answer": "**Training Method**: Practice **'Multi-Step Color Association'**. Before tapping a balloon, mentally identify the next three balloons that will be revealed and which color they will need. This trains the player to allocate time calmly and make future-proof decisions."
      },
      {
        "value": "power-up-usage-risk",
        "question": "[Risk Management] When is it risky to use a Power-up if the bottom bar has few empty slots?",
        "answer": "**Official Guidance**: If the bottom bar has only **one or two empty slots left**, using the 'Shuffle' or 'Explosion' Power-ups is extremely risky. These actions may reveal a high volume of unmatchable colors, immediately causing a **deadlock**. Use them with maximum space available."
      },
      {
        "value": "technical-lag-solutions",
        "question": "[Troubleshooting] What causes common lag issues, and what are the solutions?",
        "answer": "**Official Solution**: Lag is mainly due to **high-load 3D rendering**. The solution is to **lower the graphics quality** in settings, update to the latest browser version, and **close any unnecessary applications** running in the background."
      },
      {
        "value": "progress-save-failure",
        "question": "[Technical Fix] What causes save/progress anomalies, and how to check/fix the status?",
        "answer": "**Official Guidance**: Save anomalies are often linked to **network instability or corrupted local cache**. We recommend using the **official backup/save export feature** (if available) and **periodically refreshing the game** to force a server status synchronization."
      },
      {
        "value": "input-sensitivity-fix",
        "question": "[Control Fix] What causes touch/mouse input misjudgment (e.g., accidental double-tap)? How to optimize controls?",
        "answer": "**Optimization Tip**: Misjudgment is often due to high input sensitivity. **Adjust the 'Tap/Click Sensitivity'** in the settings to a level that prevents accidental double-tap. Also, consistently use **multi-angle rotation** to ensure the click target is fully visible, minimizing selection error."
