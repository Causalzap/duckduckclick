          "value": "long-term-strategy-efficiency",
          "question": "[Long-Term Strategy] How to maximize both money efficiency and narrative depth exploration?",
          "answer": "**Expert Strategy**: Prioritize unlocking **high-return brutal upgrades** for immediate financial efficiency, while also focusing on **key narrative upgrades** to ensure you unlock all possible ending branches for deeper exploration."
        },
        {
          "value": "avoid-bad-ending-lock",
          "question": "[Moral Threshold] When should I stop purchasing certain upgrades to avoid locking into the Bad Ending?",
          "answer": "**Warning Signs**: There is no hard number. You must **observe narrative cues and character hints** (often through textual changes or Harvey's increasing visual suffering). When these hints become severe, weigh your choices carefully, as further 'brutal' upgrades may be irreversible."
        },
        {
          "value": "resource-allocation-midgame",
          "question": "[Resource Allocation] In the mid-game, should I prioritize investing in auto-damage upgrades or click-based revenue upgrades to accelerate unlocks?",
          "answer": "**Efficiency Balance**: Prioritize **auto-damage upgrades** for sustained, passive income and efficiency. Click-based revenue should only be used to overcome immediate, high-cost investment hurdles. Weigh the **immediate efficiency** of clicking against the **long-term consistency** of automation."
        },
        {
          "value": "hidden-morality-metric",
          "question": "[Narrative Depth] Is there a hidden morality metric?",
          "answer": "**Judging the Path**: While there isn't an explicit meter, the narrative uses **visual and textual cues** (such as changes in Harvey's appearance, the game's descriptions, and the atmosphere) to indicate which ending path (Good, Bad, or Normal) your choices are currently leaning towards."
        },
        {
          "value": "revenue-maximization-loop",
          "question": "[Advanced Techniques] Is there a top-player revenue maximization loop that achieves explosive growth through a specific upgrade order?",
          "answer": "**Growth Loop**: Top players focus on a **synergistic upgrade sequence**. This involves unlocking the high-impact cruel upgrades that provide exponential boosts first, then immediately following up with critical multiplier upgrades that amplify the core output, leading to explosive, short-term growth bursts."
        },
        {
          "value": "ending-irreversible-points",
          "question": "[Narrative Branching] Are there critical irreversible points for ending unlocks? Can a player freely switch paths before a certain node?",
          "answer": "**Irreversible Choice**: The game often includes **critical, irreversible points** tied to major upgrades or specific narrative choices. While you can generally switch paths early on, be aware that past a certain threshold of 'cruel' upgrades, the **Bad Ending path may become locked and unavoidable**."
        },
        {
          "value": "pressure-management-mechanism",
          "question": "[Game Mechanics] Does the game contain an actual countdown or stress management mechanic? How should I respond?",
          "answer": "**Stress Management**: The game does not feature a traditional countdown, but the **increasing visual and atmospheric discomfort** acts as a psychological stress mechanic. Respond by assessing whether your current financial gain is worth the escalating moral and visual consequences."
        },
        {
          "value": "newbie-common-errors",
          "question": "[Newbie Pain Points] What common mistakes do new players make that lead to the Normal Ending or resource waste?",
          "answer": "Common errors include **randomly purchasing upgrades** without regard for their narrative consequence, **over-investing in a single path too early**, and **ignoring the subtle narrative prompts** that guide the player toward the Good or Bad path."
        },
        {
          "value": "moral-gain-balance",
          "question": "[Moral Balance] How to balance the desire for revenue growth with the moral perception of Harvey's suffering?",
          "answer": "**Ethical Balance**: The game's core challenge is this balance. Use the **narrative prompts and visual feedback** as your guide. If the suffering is too much to bear, intentionally invest in upgrades that are less cruel, even if they are less financially efficient, to push toward a better ending."
        },
        {
          "value": "transformation-deduction",
          "question": "[Visual Cues] How can Harvey's 'grotesque transformations' be used to deduce if the upgrade path is correct?",
          "answer": "**Transformation Analysis**: If Harvey's deformations are **rapid, extreme, and visually unsettling**, you are likely accelerating down the **Bad Ending path**. If transformations are subtler or linked to specific, contained upgrades, you may still be on a neutral or controlled route."
        },
        {
          "value": "technical-lag-solutions",
          "question": "[Technical & Troubleshooting] How can common lag or slow response issues be quickly resolved?",
          "answer": "**Quick Fix**: Lag often stems from the dynamic visual effects. It is recommended to **close background applications** and ensure your **hardware/browser is updated** to optimize rendering and response times."
        },
        {
          "value": "save-loss-prevention",
          "question": "[Data Integrity] What should I do if my save is lost when unlocking an ending?",
          "answer": "**Data Recovery**: To prevent loss, **back up your progress regularly** using the game's save export feature. If loss occurs during an ending, ensure your browser's **local storage is intact** and use the official synchronization feature (if available) to restore data."
        },
        {
          "value": "visual-audio-enhancement",
          "question": "[Aesthetics] How do sound effects and visuals (like 'Pastel Tones') enhance the atmosphere? Is customization supported?",
          "answer": "**Atmosphere Enhancement**: Effects like 'Pastel Tones' often serve to **heighten the narrative's irony** by contrasting dark subject matter with light visuals. These effects and soundscapes are carefully curated to reinforce the mood; **customization is generally not supported** to maintain the intended dark atmosphere."
