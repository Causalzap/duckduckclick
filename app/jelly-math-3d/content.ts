      {
        "value": "long-term-strategy-efficiency",
        "question": "[Long-Term Strategy] What is the best long-term strategy to maximize stars and bonuses?",
        "answer": "**Expert Strategy**: The key is prioritizing **mastery of multiplication and division**, and immediately combining this with **consecutive match combo techniques** to significantly boost efficiency and score multipliers."
      },
      {
        "value": "mode-utilization",
        "question": "[Mode Utilization] How to utilize Timed Mode and Casual Mode to improve math skills?",
        "answer": "**Official Tip**: Use **Timed Mode** to rapidly enhance your **arithmetic speed and reaction time**. Use **Casual Mode** for a deeper understanding of mathematical principles and to practice complex, long-chain elimination strategies without time pressure."
      },
      {
        "value": "resource-allocation-midgame",
        "question": "[Resource Allocation] Should I prioritize unlocking new arithmetic challenges or jelly characters in the mid-game?",
        "answer": "**Official Tip**: Mid-game success is built on skill. Prioritize unlocking **new arithmetic challenges** first to elevate difficulty and skill ceiling. Then, focus on **jelly characters** to enhance visual motivation and personalized progression."
      },
      {
        "value": "critical-jelly-identification",
        "question": "[Priority Management] How to judge critical number jellies? Which ones should be reserved?",
        "answer": "**Advanced Strategy**: Always reserve numbers involved in **complex operations (Multiplication, Division, or Parentheses)**. Decision-making should be based on **number size and operator priority**; high-value numbers are often the cornerstone of high-score equations."
      },
      {
        "value": "hidden-match-techniques",
        "question": "[Advanced Techniques] Do top players master hidden matching techniques to boost score?",
        "answer": "**Elite Secret**: Yes, top players prioritize seeking out **long elimination chains** and **high-value perfect combinations** that involve complex operators, which lead to significant score bursts."
      },
      {
        "value": "chain-reaction-mechanics",
        "question": "[Combo Strategy] How does the chain reaction mechanism work, and why is strategy crucial for it?",
        "answer": "**Mechanism Analysis**: A successful match can trigger secondary or even tertiary chain eliminations as new jellies fall into place. **Strategic placement** is crucial; plan the initial match to expose numbers that will immediately form a second equation upon falling, maximizing the chain effect."
      },
      {
        "value": "multiplication-training",
        "question": "[Speed Skill] How to train the skill of rapid calculation for multiplication and division in Timed Mode?",
