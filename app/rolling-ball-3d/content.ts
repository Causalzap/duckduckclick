          "value": "long-term-strategy-efficiency",
          "question": "[Long-Term Strategy] How to maximize survival and diamond collection?",
          "answer": "**Expert Strategy**: Prioritize investing in **stability and forgiveness upgrades** first to ensure longer survival. Only after establishing a base should you invest in **speed attributes**. The optimal path is stability-first, speed-second."
        },
        {
          "value": "high-level-risk-reward",
          "question": "[Risk Management] At what level (or speed) should players boldly take risks on platform edges for diamond rewards?",
          "answer": "**Advanced Tip**: Once you reach approximately **Level 10** or achieve **extremely high speeds** where mistakes are instant death, you should intentionally leverage the **platform edges** to collect high-risk, high-reward diamonds. The high speed makes the risk worthwhile for greater gains."
        },
        {
          "value": "resource-allocation-midgame",
          "question": "[Resource Allocation] How should diamonds be allocated in the mid-game (e.g., special balls vs. Power-ups)?",
          "answer": "**Official Guidance**: We recommend allocating $\\mathbf{70\\%}$ of diamonds to purchasing **special attribute balls** (which offer permanent strategic advantages) and $\\mathbf{30\\%}$ to **Power-ups** to enhance flexible combat capabilities during difficult runs."
        },
        {
          "value": "speed-control-strategy",
          "question": "[Speed Control] When should the player use precise, reduced speed control, and when should they sprint at full speed?",
          "answer": "**Pacing Guide**: Use **reduced speed and fine control** immediately before **complex or unknown obstacles**. Use **full-speed sprinting** on **straight sections** and across **simple, stable obstacle patterns** to maximize distance and efficiency."
        },
        {
          "value": "advanced-turning-techniques",
          "question": "[Advanced Techniques] What turning techniques do top players use to maintain speed and avoid over-correction?",
          "answer": "**Elite Secret**: Top players master **'Quick-Tap Steering'**. Instead of holding the directional button, they use rapid, light taps to adjust the ball's direction. This avoids over-correction and allows for quick recovery of balance."
        },
        {
          "value": "speed-inertia-trick",
          "question": "[Inertia Trick] How to use inertia to 'lock' speed and maintain acceleration through flat areas?",
          "answer": "**Expert Move**: Utilize **'Inertia Banking'**: After exiting a booster or a downward ramp, quickly switch to a **slight turning motion** to leverage the stored kinetic energy. This helps **maintain the accelerated state** through otherwise flat or neutral sections where speed would normally decay."
        },
        {
          "value": "platform-edging-technique",
          "question": "[Risk Strategy] What is the 'platform edging' technique used to maximize speed and score?",
          "answer": "**High-Risk Strategy**: The 'Edging' technique involves steering the ball **just along the very edge of the tilting platform**. This maximizes the speed benefit gained from the platform's inclination while simultaneously increasing the multiplier score, but demands absolute precision to avoid falling."
        },
        {
          "value": "beginner-common-mistakes",
          "question": "[Beginner Mistakes] What are the common errors that lead to early failure for new players?",
          "answer": "Common errors include: **Over-steering** leading to immediate loss of control, **ignoring far-off obstacles** (lack of forward vision), and **blindly accelerating** without regard for the platform's stability."
        },
        {
          "value": "training-methodology",
          "question": "[Training Method] What is the best way to train prediction of dynamic obstacle movement?",
          "answer": "**Training Tip**: **Focus on Dynamic Change**. Repeatedly practice runs where you **only focus on the movement pattern of distant obstacles**. This trains your brain to anticipate and predict their movement trajectory well in advance, allowing for smoother path adjustments."
        },
        {
          "value": "visual-safety-cues",
          "question": "[Visual Cues] Are there visual cues to help distinguish platform safety?",
          "answer": "**Game Cues**: Generally, **stable, flat, and darker-colored platforms** are safer. **Steeply inclined platforms and those with noticeable breaks or rapid movement** are high-risk zones that require immediate speed reduction and fine control."
        },
        {
          "value": "technical-lag-solutions",
          "question": "[Technical Fix] What causes lag and physics delay, and what is the solution?",
          "answer": "**Official Solution**: Lag and delay are typically caused by **intensive physics calculation**. We advise **closing all unnecessary programs** and **optimizing the graphics settings** (lowering quality) to reduce the computational load on your device."
        },
        {
          "value": "progress-save-failure",
          "question": "[Technical Fix] How to resolve progress saving anomalies?",
          "answer": "**Official Guidance**: To prevent progress loss, users must **regularly back up their game data** using the official in-game backup tools. Check your network connection before and after each long run to ensure proper synchronization."
        },
        {
          "value": "input-sensitivity-fix",
          "question": "[Control Optimization] How to adjust sensitivity for gear and button responsiveness to reduce mis-input?",
          "answer": "**Optimization Tip**: Adjust the **Sensitivity settings** for both controller/keyboard input and gear responsiveness to a **medium level**. This setting balances the need for precise input (reducing mis-taps) with the rapid response required for high-speed parkour."
