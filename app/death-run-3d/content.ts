      "items": [
        {
          "value": "long-term-strategy-efficiency",
          "question": "[Long-Term Strategy] What is the best long-term strategy to maximize survival time and leaderboard ranking?",
          "answer": "**Expert Strategy**: The best long-term strategy is the combination of prioritizing **extreme micro-adjustment practice** with **obstacle pattern memory training**. This synergy is vital for handling escalating speeds."
        },
        {
          "value": "difficulty-jump-threshold",
          "question": "[Pacing] At what survival time threshold does the game's difficulty jump exponentially, and how should strategy be adjusted?",
          "answer": "**Threshold Alert**: Difficulty typically exhibits an **exponential leap** after the $\\mathbf{120-second}$ survival threshold. Players must adjust strategy from reactive dodging to **proactive pattern recognition and minimal steering input**."
        },
        {
          "value": "psychological-stability",
          "question": "[Psychology & Control] What are effective methods for training stable hands and zero-latency neural reaction?",
          "answer": "**Training Method**: Effective methods include **controlled breathing exercises** and **focused concentration training** outside the game. This stability translates directly to precise, non-twitchy micro-adjustments required for long runs."
        },
        {
          "value": "gap-navigation-strategy",
          "question": "[Obstacle Strategy] When is it best to quickly pass through a block gap, and when is cautious micro-adjustment better?",
          "answer": "**Tactical Choice**: **Quick passing** is viable only for visibly wide gaps. For **narrow gaps or complex, moving obstacles**, cautious **micro-adjustment** is mandatory to avoid the 1mm error that leads to instant collision."
        },
        {
          "value": "advanced-vision-tricks",
          "question": "[Advanced Techniques] What 'vision focus' tricks do top players use to boost obstacle identification speed?",
          "answer": "**Elite Skill**: Top players utilize **'Peripheral Vision Focus'** and **'Screen Calibration'** (mentally anchoring the center). This allows them to quickly process block changes happening in the periphery without taking their eyes off the core path, significantly boosting recognition speed."
        },
        {
          "value": "physics-limit-point",
          "question": "[Physics Limit] Is there a physical critical point for passing through gaps?",
          "answer": "**Physics Insight**: Yes, the critical point is often when **a sliver of visible light** is still present on the edge of the screen—this is the physical minimum required for safe passage. Trusting this minimal visible space is key to successful high-speed runs."
        },
        {
          "value": "visual-afterimage-prediction",
          "question": "[Prediction] How can players use visual afterimages to aid in predicting block movement trajectories?",
          "answer": "**Visual Aid**: Pay attention to the **visual trails or afterimages** left by rapidly moving blocks. This visual phenomenon can subtly aid your brain in predicting the block's ongoing trajectory, effectively speeding up your reaction time."
        },
        {
          "value": "newbie-common-errors",
          "question": "[Newbie Pain Points] What are the common beginner errors that cause quick failure?",
          "answer": "Common errors include **over-steering/excessive movement**, **focusing only on the immediate block**, and **failing to anticipate** obstacles that are about to appear down the tunnel (lack of foresight)."
        },
        {
          "value": "attention-shift-training",
          "question": "[Training Method] How should beginners train shifting their attention to the next upcoming obstacle?",
          "answer": "**Training Tip**: Practice the **'Look Ahead' method**. Consciously force your attention to focus on the second or third obstacle coming up, rather than the one currently passing you. This proactive focus is essential for survival."
        },
        {
          "value": "survival-vs-precision-balance",
          "question": "[Operational Balance] How to balance the instinctual large movements of self-preservation with the micro-adjustments needed for success?",
          "answer": "**Balance Key**: Acknowledge the instinct to over-steer, but immediately follow it with an aggressive, conscious commitment to **minimalist micro-adjustment**. The key is to constantly suppress the urge to make large, panic-driven movements."
        },
        {
          "value": "technical-lag-solution",
          "question": "[Technical Troubleshooting] Common solutions for frequent lag and input delay?",
          "answer": "**Quick Fix**: Lag is often due to the high-speed rendering. **Close all other background programs** and **lower the graphics quality/effects settings** to dedicate maximum processing power to the game's physics and rendering."
        },
        {
          "value": "score-sync-issue",
          "question": "[Data Integrity] Score synchronization frequently fails; what steps should be taken to fix it?",
          "answer": "**Sync Check**: **Check your network connection stability** first. If issues persist, **refresh the game page**. Consistent synchronization is critical for leaderboard updates."
        },
