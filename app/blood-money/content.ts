    {
      question: "Does BLOODMONEY! Support Offline Income?",
      answer: "No Offline Earnings: The game does not provide offline income. You must keep interacting with the game to progress, making it more suited for active players rather than idle gameplay."
    },
    {
      question: "How Does Harvey's Pain Level Affect the Ending?",
      answer: "Pain Level Impact: Harvey's pain level accumulates based on the weapons you use. Higher pain levels lead to the Bad Ending, while lower pain levels favor the Good Ending. Story and Dialogue: The pain level also affects the storyline, dialogue, and the final moments between you and Harvey."

  conclusion: "Whether you choose the Good Ending for its ethical challenges, the Bad Ending for the fastest profits, or the Normal Ending for a balanced approach, BLOODMONEY! offers a deeply engaging experience that tests both your strategic thinking and moral compass. Maximize your ROI with smart upgrades, but remember that your decisions will shape the story. Will you choose the path of greed or the path of virtue?"
