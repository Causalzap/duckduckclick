      title: "Large Cluster Removal",
      description: "The key to a high score is targeting the largest clusters of bubbles. Clearing big groups of bubbles in one shot will give you a much bigger score than clearing smaller, isolated bubbles.",
      tips: [
        "Always look for groups of 5 or more bubbles of the same color",
        "Aim for clusters that are connected to the main group for chain reactions",
